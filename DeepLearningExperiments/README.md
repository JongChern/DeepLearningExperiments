#An Example/Experiment Using Neural Networks to Recognize an ECG signal

Note that the structure of the neural networks used is based on a picture recognition example provided by DL4J. Rather than a single row vector of data values representing the RGB pixel values a single row ECG signal is used. Note that for time series data, LSTM might be a better choice.

#Description of Data
Labelled ECG data was collected at 128 Hz using [Consensys](http://shimmersensing.com/products/consensys).
